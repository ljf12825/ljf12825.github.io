<h1>👨‍💻知  & 💡识</h1><br>
The brain has a similar LRU mechanism,<br>
so some knowledge needs to find an "extra environment" to store.<br>
Everything and understanding of them is constantly changing,<br>
so everything is constantly changing also!<br>
I pursue first principles, original documents and unprocessed sources of knowledge,<br>
pure, solid, independent and thoughtful just like espresso!<br>
If what I recorded is helpful to you<br>
It's My Pleasure!<br>
