> Code for myself

```text
The brain works much like an LRU cache,
so some knowledge needs an external environment to be stored.

Everything—and our understanding of it—is constantly changing.
Therefore, everything must keep evolving.

I pursue first principles, original documents, and unprocessed sources of knowledge:
pure, solid, independent, and thoughtful—like a shot of espresso.

If what I record here is helpful to you, it is my pleasure.
If you find any errors, please feel free to contact me.

If one day this site is no longer updated,
please check the latest commit for the most recent changes.

Status: ALIVE
