## C++
[ISO/IEC 14882:xxxx](https://www.iso.org/) : The official C++ standard document, serving as a legal and technical specification rather than a learning guide. Developed by the International Standardization Organization (ISO). It strictly defines C++ syntax, semantics, standard library behavior, and the principles that all implementations (compilers) must adhere to. These standards documents are paid for and must be purchased from ISO or a national standards organization. `xxxx` means publish year.

The format is standardized, and each page includes syntax, parameters, return values, exceptions, complexity, sample code, related links, etc. The standard version is marked, clearly indicating which C++ standard the feature was Introductiond in. Most sample code can be edited and run on the page

[C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) : This project, maintained by Bjarne Stroustrup, the father of C++, and numerous experts, aims to guide developers in using modern C++ correctly, efficiently, and safely. It's not a syntax reference, but rather a collection of best practices. It includes hundreds of rules, each with rationale and examples.

It includes documentation for the .NET platform, the C# language, all Base Class Libraries (BCLs), ASP.NET Core, EF Core, and more. You can easily switch between documentation for different .NET versions (such as .NET 8, .NET 6, and the .NET Framework) to avoid issues caused by API differences. It includes "concept" articles (tutorials and guides), automatically generated API references, code samples, and quickstarts. Many pages have built-in "Run" buttons, allowing you to edit and run code samples directly in your browser (based on .NET Jupyter Notebooks).

[lua.org](https://lua.org/) : This is the definitive, core Lua reference document, written and maintained by the Lua team (PUC-Rio). All other reference resources build on it. It fully defines the syntax, semantics, standard library, and C API of the Lua language (currently the latest version is 5.4). The document style is highly technical, with no redundant explanations and straightforward to the point. Sections provide detailed coverage of basic concepts, the language, the standard library (`strings`, `tables`, `io`, `operating systems`, `math`, `debugging`, etc.), and how to embed and extend Lua. For all Lua developers.
