# How to Develop a Game Guide

Developing a game is to build a virtual world. It can be roughly divided into the following modules. The content of this website is mainly related to `coding`, and other content will mention some.

## Engine and Basics

The game engine is the foundation of the entire development workflow.

* **Unity**: Built around a Component-Based Architecture (`GameObject + Component`), driven by C# scripting. Its ecosystem is mature and versatile, suitable for small to medium-sized teams and cross-platform development.
* **Unreal Engine (UE)**: Powered by C++ at the core with Blueprint for visual scripting. Known for high-end rendering, modular architecture, and large team collaboration, it’s the standard for AAA projects.
* **Toolchain**: Compilers (MSVC, Clang, GCC), build systems (CMake, Gradle), debuggers (gdb, lldb), and profilers (Unity Profiler, RenderDoc, PIX) form the developer’s toolbox.
  A solid grasp of engine basics (scenes, prefabs, materials, animation systems), paired with a working toolchain, marks the true starting point of game development.

## Graphics and Rendering

Rendering defines the game’s visual fidelity and performance.

* **Math Foundations**: Vectors, matrices, homogeneous coordinates, and quaternions (for rotation without gimbal lock).
* **Rendering Pipeline**: From **Vertex Shader → Primitive Assembly → Rasterization → Fragment Shader → Output Merger**. Understanding the GPU pipeline is essential for advanced work.
* **Shader Programming**: Physically Based Rendering (PBR), Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDF), forward vs. deferred rendering.
* **Lighting & Shadows**: Global Illumination (GI), Ambient Occlusion (AO), shadow mapping, volumetric lighting.
* **Post-Processing**: Bloom, Motion Blur, SSAO, HDR tone mapping.
* **Optimization**: Batching, occlusion culling, Level of Detail (LOD), GPU instancing.
  Here, theory (math & algorithms) must meet practice (profiling and optimization).

## Game Logic and System

Gameplay systems bring mechanics to life.

* **Core Systems**: Input handling, physics (rigidbody, collision, raycasting), UI frameworks (UGUI, Slate), and animation state machines.
* **Advanced Systems**: Quest & achievement systems, combat/cooldown mechanics, inventory & equipment systems, save/load workflows (JSON, binary serialization).
* **Tool Support**: Custom inspectors, level editors, visual debugging tools, hot-reloading.
  Architectural approaches such as **event-driven design**, **ECS (Entity-Component-System)**, and **data-driven development** ensure scalability and maintainability.

## AI and Behaviour

AI adds life and intelligence to gameplay.

* **Classical Approaches**: Finite State Machines (FSM), Behavior Trees, Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP).
* **Pathfinding**: A\*, Dijkstra, NavMesh navigation, steering behaviors for dynamic avoidance.
* **Machine Learning**: Unity ML-Agents, TensorFlow, or ONNX for reinforcement learning and adaptive NPCs.
* **Decision Systems**: Blackboard pattern, Utility AI for dynamic decision-making.
  A strong AI design balances **designer control** and **believable behavior**.

## Audio and Sound

Audio drives immersion as much as visuals.

* **Sound Effects**: Feedback sounds (combat, UI clicks), environmental ambience (wind, rain, echo).
* **Music**: Dynamic and adaptive music systems that react to player state (exploration, combat, victory).
* **3D Audio**: Spatialization (HRTF), distance attenuation, Doppler effects.
* **Middleware**: FMOD and Wwise enable event-driven audio and advanced adaptive sound systems.

## Resource and Art

Art and assets define the game’s style and performance.

* **Models & Textures**: Polygon count optimization, normal maps, PBR materials.
* **Animation**: Skeletal animation, blend trees, procedural IK and ragdoll physics.
* **VFX**: Particle systems (Unity’s Shuriken, UE’s Niagara), shader-based effects (water, fire, energy).
* **Resource Management**: AssetBundles/Addressables (Unity), Pak files (UE), streaming systems.
* **Optimization**: Texture compression (ASTC, DXT), mesh batching, memory pooling.
  Technical artists bridge programming and art, ensuring resources are both beautiful and efficient.

## Architecture and Design

Large-scale projects demand maintainable architecture.

* **Modularization**: Decoupling UI, AI, rendering, and audio.
* **Data-Driven Development**: JSON/XML/CSV configs, scripting with Lua or custom DSLs.
* **ECS**: Highly efficient entity processing (Unity DOTS, UE Mass).
* **Performance & Memory**: Object pooling, GC optimization, cache-friendly data layouts.
* **Cross-Platform Adaptation**: Handling input, storage, and rendering API differences across platforms.

## Game Planning and Design

Tech decides *what can be done*; design decides *whether it’s fun*.

* **Core Loop**: Example: RPG loop of *fight → level up → collect gear → fight stronger enemies*.
* **Mechanics**: Movement, combat, economy, crafting, social systems.
* **Balancing**: XP curves, damage formulas, resource flow.
* **Level & Narrative Design**: Guiding exploration, pacing, storytelling.
* **Player Psychology**: Rewards, risk vs. reward, challenge vs. skill balance (Flow theory).

## Project and Profile

Game development is also about engineering discipline and career growth.

* **Project Management**: Agile workflows (Scrum, Kanban), version control (Git Flow), CI/CD pipelines.
