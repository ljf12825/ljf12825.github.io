`👨‍💻知  & 💡识`

`The brain has a similar LRU mechanism, so some knowledge needs to find an "extra environment" to store.`

`Everything and understanding of them is constantly changing, so everything is constantly changing also!`

`I pursue first principles, original documents and unprocessed sources of knowledge, pure, solid, independent and thoughtful just like espresso!`

`If what I recorded is helpful to you, it's My Pleasure!`

`If there are any errors, please contact with me.`

`If one day my site is no longer updated, please check the latest push in Recent Posts`
